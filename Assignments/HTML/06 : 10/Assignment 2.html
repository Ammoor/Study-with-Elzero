    Assignment 2: 

    No there is no difference between these 3 elements ( "" = '' = one word as a value to attribute ).
    
    But when you type one word as a value to attribute there is no need to put the single/double quotes.

    However it's not recommended to do that because if you typed more than one word it will behave 
    unlike you expect because it will treat only the first word as a value of the attribute 
    and the rest of the other words will be treated as attributes.
