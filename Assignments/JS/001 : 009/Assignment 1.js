/*

Assignment 1:

The code that will not execute is the code number one.

And the reason is because the code number one tries to access an element that is not created yet in the
Document Object Model (DOM).

Unlike code number two that will wait the entire page to load and then will access the element and the code
number three which in the end of the body tag that will access the element after all the content created in the 
DOM.
